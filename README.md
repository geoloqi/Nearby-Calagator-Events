Sample Geoloqi Layer
====================

This is a simple Ruby script for setting up a new Geoloqi layer. It creates places and triggers for 
sending messages to people when they enter the places. 

When people enter the places, they will get a push notification or SMS sent to them, which can 
include a URL as well. They will also see a story with information about the place on their home timeline
when logging in to the website.

You can find more sample code on the Geoloqi Developers website https://developers.geoloqi.com/sample-code
